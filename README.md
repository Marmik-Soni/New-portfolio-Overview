âœ… **Free Services:**
- **Frontend Hosting:** Vercel
- **Backend Hosting:** Render/Railway
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (free up to 500MB)

2. **Design the UI** (Home, About, Skills, Contact, Projects)
3. **Build the blogging system** (CRUD functionality for blog posts)
4. **Develop the chat system** (visitor-to-you only messaging)
5. **Test everything & deploy on free hosting**
